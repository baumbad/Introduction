Welcome to my GitHub page!

I have several private repositories that house college coursework. Because these classes are still providing similar assingments,
we have been asked to keep these assignments private. If you wish to have acess to these files, please reach out to be provided access.
Repositories house assignmnets for the following classes, each highlighting a differnet aspect of the course:


CSE 160: Data Programming
  Introduction to computer programming. Assignments solve real data manipulation tasks from science, engineering, business, and the humanities. 
  Concepts of computational thinking, problem-solving, data analysis, Python programming, control and data abstraction, file processing, and 
  data visualization
         
CSE 143: Computer Programming II
  This course focuses on concepts of data abstraction and encapsulation, including stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, recursion,  
  instruction to complexity and use of predefined collection classes.

CSE 373: Data Structures and Algorithms
  Fundamental algorithms and data structures for implementation. Techniques for solving problems by programming. Linked lists, stacks, queues, 
  directed graphs. Trees: representations, traversals. Searching (hashing, binary search trees, multiway trees). Garbage collection, memory management. 
  Internal and external sorting.
